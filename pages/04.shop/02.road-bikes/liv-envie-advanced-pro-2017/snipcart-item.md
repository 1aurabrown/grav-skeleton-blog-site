## Details 

A proven winner with big-time race victories, this is the reigning queen of aero road. Attack, sprint, get that podium.

It’s no surprise that the first women’s-specific aero road bike would be eye-catchingly sleek with elegant finishing, but this speedy weapon can also dish it out in all aspects of speed and handling. With an ultra-lightweight build, this bike gets downright punchy on the climbs and greater stiffness means precise handling. It all adds up to the ultimate aero race machine for sprints, short-distance triathlons and everyday training on the road.
